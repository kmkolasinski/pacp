\title{Exact computation for Ising model for 2D and 1D}

\maketitle
This is short theoretical explanation of the test: \textbf{IsingTestExact1D.h}
and \textbf{IsingTestExact2D.h}.


\section{Combinatorial approach}

We calculate exact solution of specific heat by finding the exact
value of the partition function 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z(\beta) & = & \sum_{\{\mathrm{all\, configurations\,\sigma_{i}}\}}e^{-\beta E\left(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},...,\sigma_{n}\right)}.
\end{eqnarray*}


To do that we have to evaluate all possible configurations of spins.
For given number $n$ of spins on the lattice we have $2^{n}$ configurations.
For example for two spins chain we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{} & \left\{ \uparrow\uparrow,\downarrow\uparrow,\uparrow\downarrow,\downarrow\downarrow\right\}  & .
\end{eqnarray*}


Note that some of those configurations may have the same energy $E$,
thus $Z$ function can be written in a bit different way
\begin{equation}
Z(\beta)=\sum_{E_{i}}N(E_{i})e^{-\beta E_{i}},\label{eq:z}
\end{equation}


where the sum runs over all possible energies $E_{i}$, and $N(E_{i})$
is density of states: number of states with the same energy $E_{i}$. 

To generate $N(E)$ we have to calculate $E$ for all configurations
of spins. In order to do that we use Gray code enumeration of spins
(the description of the algorithm can be found e.g. in textbook: \emph{Statistical
Mechanics Algorithms and Computations}, Werner Krauth). The pseudo-code
of the algorithm is following:

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Gray code for spins $\{1,....,N\}$. The procedure returns $k$ which
is the index of next spin to flip. $\tau$ is an auxiliary vector
used by the procedure. The initial value of $\tau_{i}=i$. Look in
the code to see how to use it in practice.}


\end{figure}
Having the $N(E)$ allows us to calculate all properties of the system
from (\ref{eq:z}). As an example we calculated plots of specific
heat $C_{V}$ in function of temperature $T$. The specific heat is
given by expression 
\[
C_{V}=\frac{\partial\left\langle E\right\rangle }{\partial T},
\]


where $\left\langle E\right\rangle =-\frac{\partial\log(Z)}{\partial\beta}=T^{2}\frac{\partial\log(Z)}{\partial T}$.
Thus we have
\[
C_{V}=2T\frac{\partial\log(Z)}{\partial T}+T^{2}\frac{\partial^{2}\log(Z)}{\partial T^{2}}.
\]


For simplicity we calculate $C_{V}$ using numerical differentiation
using the finite difference method, which leads to following approximation
\begin{eqnarray*}
C_{V} & \left(T\right)\approx & 2T\left(\frac{\log\left(Z(T+\Delta T)\right)-\log\left(Z(T-\Delta T)\right)}{2\Delta T}\right)\\
 & + & T^{2}\left(\frac{\log\left(Z(T+\Delta T)\right)+\log\left(Z(T-\Delta T)\right)-2\log\left(Z(T)\right)}{\Delta T^{2}}\right).
\end{eqnarray*}


We choose small value of $\Delta T=0.01$ which should give us accurate
approximation of $C_{V}$. 

Note that this approach gives us exact solution to 2D Ising model,
but it is limited to very small lattice sizes. The bottleneck of the
algorithm is the part where we calculate $N(E)$ using Gray code.
This is because we have to run over $2^{n}$ states which for lattice
of size $6\times6$ gives $2^{36}=68719476736$ number of possible
configurations. 


\section{Results for 1D chain}

The appropriate test class has name: IsingTestExact1D.

We calculate specific heat for three different chain lengths: N=\textbf{2,7}
and \textbf{22}. We also compared this with analytical one. For 1D
the partition function is given by following equation
\[
Z\left(T\right)=\left(2\cosh(\beta J)\right)^{N}\cdot\left(1+\tanh(\beta J)^{N}\right),
\]


from this we can calculate Cv per spin
\begin{equation}
C_{V}^{\mathrm{spin}}(T)=\frac{T}{N}\frac{\partial^{2}T\log\left(Z\left(T\right)\right)}{\partial T^{2}}.\label{eq:analitycal}
\end{equation}


The numerical approximation of derivative above can be found in function
\textbf{exacCv()}.

The results for exact solution (Combinatorial approach) and analytical
solution (\ref{eq:analitycal}) are shown in the picture below.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Specific heat for 1D Ising chain for N=2, 7 and 22. The plot is generated
by IsingTestExact1D class.}


\end{figure}


From the picture above we see that for large temperatures ($T\rightarrow+\infty$)
$C_{V}$ tends to zero. We have the same behavior for $T\rightarrow0$. 


\section{Results for 2D chain}

The appropriate test class has name: IsingTestExact2D.

The analytical solution for 2D lattice exist but is more complicated
thus we plot only the results from the combinatorial method. This
method allowed us to calculate lattices up to 5x5. The results are
presented below.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\paperwidth]{/home/mkk/DANE/Doktorat/ZAJECIA/PhysicsAtCP/trunk/IsingModelSimulations5_2/tests_out/IsingTestExact2D}

\caption{Specific heat for 2D Ising lattice for four different lattices size.
The plot is generated by IsingTestExact2D class. Vertical line shows
the exact value of critical temperature $T_{C}$.}
\end{figure}


From figure above we see that the phase transition for small lattices
occurs near the critical temperature $T_{C}$ obtained from exact
Onsager calculations. For 2D lattice we have the same asymptotic behavior
($T\rightarrow0$ and $T\rightarrow+\infty$) like it was in case
of 1D chain.
